# MiniShogi

This game implements a user interactive version of MiniShogi, a Japanese variant
of traditional chess.

The game validates moves made by each player, checking legality and safety of each move. 
It also provides hints when a player is put into check by the opponent, and will display a list of all possible moves to remove the player from check.

### 2 modes:

1. Interactive Mode

   run as `java myShogi -i`

2. File Mode

   run as `java myShogi -f /path/to/file/`
